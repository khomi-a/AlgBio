# AlgBio
Algorithmic bioinformatic tasks for MIPT coursework

## Task 1 - De Brujn Assembly

Based on the given .fastq files we have to give an output of assembled contigs.\
Folder for data and outputs - `./data` and `./contigs` respectively.\
Following packages are required:
* [networkx](https://networkx.org/)
* [pyfastx](https://github.com/lmdu/pyfastx)
* tqdm

## Task 2 - Mass spectrometry

Based on the given unknown spectrum we have to determin the proteins' amino acid chain:\

Following packages are required:
* numpy

## Task 3 - Synteny search

We have to:
* find synteny blocks for X-chromosomes of mouse and human.
* find 2-break distances between circualized chromosomes.
* determine *maxDistance* and *minSize* influence on these distances.
Look through functions [here](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track).

## Task 4 - Longest repeat in a string

[Problem](https://rosalind.info/problems/ba9d/)

Solution is based on Ukkonen's linear-time algorithm for suffix trees ([link1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukkonen%27s_algorithm), [link2](https://habr.com/ru/post/681940/)).

## Task 5 - Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform

We have to implement BWT for Mycoplasmoides pneumoniae's M129 [sequence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000912.1).
